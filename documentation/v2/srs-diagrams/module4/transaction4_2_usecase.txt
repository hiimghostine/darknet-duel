Use Case: Infrastructure State Tracking (Secure, Vulnerable, Compromised, Fortified)

Description: Allows the system to track and update the state of infrastructure cards (e.g., secure, vulnerable, compromised, fortified) as a result of player actions and card effects. Players can view the current state of all infrastructure cards.

Actors: Player

Preconditions: Game session is active and infrastructure cards are in play.

Main Flow:
1. System initializes infrastructure cards with default states.
2. Player actions or card effects trigger state changes (e.g., attack, defend, fortify).
3. System updates the state of affected infrastructure cards.
4. Players view the updated state of all infrastructure cards in real time.

Postconditions: Infrastructure card states are accurately tracked and visible to all players.
