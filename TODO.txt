# TODO.txt

## Theme Support Implementation ✅
- [x] Refactor all text color classes in BalatroGameBoard.tsx and its subcomponents to use theme/daisyUI variables (e.g., text-base-content, text-primary, text-error, etc.) instead of hardcoded Tailwind colors (e.g., text-gray-300, text-white, text-red-100, etc.), so that all text is readable in both light and dark themes.
- [x] Update helper functions (getInfraStateClasses, getPlayerCardClasses, etc.) to use only background and border colors for team/role, but always use text-base-content or text-base-content/70 for text color, unless a semantic color (e.g., text-error, text-success) is needed for status.
- [x] Fix hover card views (both player hand and infrastructure) to use theme-aware text colors instead of hardcoded colors like text-amber-100, text-blue-100, etc.
- [x] Fix special indicators and cycle buttons to use theme-aware colors.
- [x] Fix effects overlay sections to use theme-aware colors.
- [x] Fix monitoring and effects indicators to use theme-aware colors.
- [ ] Audit and update all board overlay components (e.g., WinnerLobby, PostGameChat, PlayerInfo, GlobalEffectsIndicator, TemporaryEffectsDisplay, WildcardChoiceUI) to ensure text colors use theme/daisyUI classes and are readable in both themes.
