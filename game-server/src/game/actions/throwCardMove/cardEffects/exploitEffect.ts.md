**Location:** `game-server/src/game/actions/throwCardMove/cardEffects/exploitEffect.ts`

## File Overview

This file provides the effect handler for exploit cards in Darknet Duel. It defines the logic for applying an exploit effect to a target infrastructure, specifically adding vulnerabilities and updating the state based on the current infrastructure state.

- **Primary export:** `exploitEffect`
- **Dependencies:** Shared game and card types.
- **Purpose:** To encapsulate the logic for exploit card effects.

---

## Main Components

### 1. `exploitEffect(currentInfra, infraIndex, updatedInfrastructure, card, attackVector?, playerID?)`
- **Purpose:** Applies the effect of an exploit card to the target infrastructure.
- **Parameters:**
  - `currentInfra`: The target infrastructure card.
  - `infraIndex`: The index of the target infrastructure in the array.
  - `updatedInfrastructure`: The full array of infrastructure cards.
  - `card`: The card being played.
  - `attackVector`: (Optional) The attack vector being used.
  - `playerID`: (Optional) The ID of the acting player.
- **Returns:**
  - The updated infrastructure array after applying the effect.
- **Logic:**
  - Handles different infrastructure states:
    - If fortified, weakens to 'fortified_weaken'.
    - If 'fortified_weaken', makes vulnerable and adds vulnerabilities.
    - If secure, makes vulnerable and adds vulnerabilities.
  - Adds both simple string and full vulnerability objects for compatibility.
- **Side Effects:**
  - Logs actions for debugging.

## Example Usage

Used by the main card effect router to process exploit card effects during a throw card move.

## Notes
- The function is robust to infrastructure state and includes safety checks for vulnerability application.
- Debug logging is present for troubleshooting effect logic.
